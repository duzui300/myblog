# My Experience with Language Learning

firstly let me introduce my strategy I used before and my experience learning Japanese and English. 

## Japanese

For japanese, ive learned it for over 3 years. firstly ive read [Japanese Grammar Guide](https://guidetojapanese.org/learn/grammar) to grasp a basic framework of the grammar. and then for the first year i mainly focused on studying textbooks, averagely 3 hours a day I think, which supplemented the details of grammar and got me a solid vocabulary. At the end of the first half year I passed JLPT N2 and the first year JLPT N1. its kind of surprising but because my mother tongue is chinese which gives me some advantages in kanji and also due to watching animes for years aquantanted me with Japanese pronunciation so its not imagineable. Still the problem is i could barely speak it or communicate in japanese though i could read much.

After that, I started to read some japanese books, started from セガハード戦記 which narrates the history of videogames and consoles with a focus on sega. Also some books about linguistics, history, philosophy and art. Mostly non-fiction cuz i found its easier to understand rather than fictions and novels that use too many words to describe a scene or some actions. In my opinion the abstract thinking pattern like logic, deduction etc is kind of universal throughout different language and it's always more readable for learners. To read these sorts of books can also guanrantee you the ability to organize your embedded abstract thinking process in the language. I participated in the japanese corner of my university but still didnt speak much due to the lack of environment. But still laterly i realized this enormous exposure to the language through reading made my brain get more used to the structure of jp and how to organize it to not just understand what ive heard or read, but also indirectedly improve my output ability.

the first half of the third year is when i lived in japan as an exchange student. that immersive environment and daily usage built the foundation of my speaking and listening. but im introverted so without much actively talking, it was still not enough to understand most conversations and express most of my thoughts. Actually after I passed N1, I've never read any textbooks or anything used for formal learning. The only thing I keep doing is just read some books, watch random videos on youtube in japanese.

the next pinpoint is three months ago when I bought a new laptop and restarted VRChat. Despite of some weirdos you might meet, this game is literally a heaven for language learners. With all those language exchange worlds, groups and events, and all the interesting people no matter multilingual or not with the same passion for language, it can boost up your motivation and give you more concrete feedback on your progress by directly immerse yourself into the environment and communicating with native speakers. Another good point of the game is even shy guys like me could get the chance. Sometimes you just stand by and listen to others talking and they might greet to you and strike up a conversation. You can also choose the ways to communicate as you like, talking when you want, or typing if you're not in the mood to talk. Through these three months, my speaking and listening of jp have attained much more adavancement than that half year in japan to be honest. There're still many things left to hone. Maybe kinda complacent but i think it could be listed as an achivement here to be taught by my several japanese friends that my japanese is almost native now.


## English



## My Strategy So far


## Spanish

I learned Spanish for half a year in japan but almost forgot most the content except some basic vocabulary and grammars. Wanting to get back into Spanish while not much willingly to reread the textbooks and memorize all the words again, I've started to try some different methods from the past.
