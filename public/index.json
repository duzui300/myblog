[{"content":"My Experience with Language Learning firstly let me introduce my strategy I used before and my experience learning Japanese and English.\nJapanese For japanese, ive learned it for over 3 years. firstly ive read Japanese Grammar Guide to grasp a basic framework of the grammar. and then for the first year i mainly focused on studying textbooks, averagely 3 hours a day I think, which supplemented the details of grammar and got me a solid vocabulary. At the end of the first half year I passed JLPT N2 and the first year JLPT N1. its kind of surprising but because my mother tongue is chinese which gives me some advantages in kanji and also due to watching animes for years aquantanted me with Japanese pronunciation so its not imagineable. Still the problem is i could barely speak it or communicate in japanese though i could read much.\nAfter that, I started to read some japanese books, started from セガハード戦記 which narrates the history of videogames and consoles with a focus on sega. Also some books about linguistics, history, philosophy and art. Mostly non-fiction cuz i found its easier to understand rather than fictions and novels that use too many words to describe a scene or some actions. In my opinion the abstract thinking pattern like logic, deduction etc is kind of universal throughout different language and it\u0026rsquo;s always more readable for learners. To read these sorts of books can also guanrantee you the ability to organize your embedded abstract thinking process in the language. I participated in the japanese corner of my university but still didnt speak much due to the lack of environment. But still laterly i realized this enormous exposure to the language through reading made my brain get more used to the structure of jp and how to organize it to not just understand what ive heard or read, but also indirectedly improve my output ability.\nthe first half of the third year is when i lived in japan as an exchange student. that immersive environment and daily usage built the foundation of my speaking and listening. but im introverted so without much actively talking, it was still not enough to understand most conversations and express most of my thoughts. the next half was mainly\nEnglish My Strategy So far Spanish I learned Spanish for half a year in japan but almost forgot most the content except some basic vocabulary and grammars. Wanting to get back into Spanish while not much willingly to reread the textbooks and memorize all the words again, I\u0026rsquo;ve started to try some different methods from the past.\nセガハード戦記\n以 Sega 为重心讲述电子游戏与家用游戏发展历程的一本书。我在推特写的读后感还被作者本人转发了！！（开心）\n言語学の教室　哲学者と学ぶ認知言語学\n文章采用对谈形式，笔者对于一切有疑问的问题都会当场提出，展开精彩的辩论与分析，各篇选题也非常有意思。这本书点燃了我一年半学习日语过程中所积累的薪柴，让我爱上了语言这一富有魅力的事物。\n拉丁语与古典的探索 “从他们身上，我第一次发现，原来学习一门古典语言的理由可以这么丰富。有些同学明确说，他/她不学古典学，也无意从事相关研究，学习古希腊语单纯是为了挑战、为了一丝模糊的兴趣、为了让生活暂时从‘现代性’中抽离。古典的疗愈作用，大抵如此。”\n作为对过去的总结，我想说：\n感谢过去的这一年，这是我无法预测的人生。它时常让我感到焦虑与恐惧，但也正是因此，我现在深深地爱着它。\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/language-learning-record/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"my-experience-with-language-learning\"\u003eMy Experience with Language Learning\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efirstly let me introduce my strategy I used before and my experience learning Japanese and English.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"japanese\"\u003eJapanese\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor japanese, ive learned it for over 3 years. firstly ive read \u003ca href=\"https://guidetojapanese.org/learn/grammar\"\u003eJapanese Grammar Guide\u003c/a\u003e to grasp a basic framework of the grammar. and then for the first year i mainly focused on studying textbooks, averagely 3 hours a day I think, which supplemented the details of grammar and got me a solid vocabulary.
